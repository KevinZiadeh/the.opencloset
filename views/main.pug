          | While we’re spending money excessively, who doesn’t want a 
          | little more? Earn two times more by lending your pieces
          | before you decide to resell them, and underwrite those 
          |  by temporarily sharing it with people just like you.

          p Why Borrow?
        p.explanation 
          | Instead of going to your closet for something to wear on a Friday 
          | night, you go to one of the many fast fashion stores instead, 
          | because it’s cheaper and newer feels better. With the rise of fast
          | fashion and compulsive consumerism, having a big appetite for 
          | fashion comes at a cost — a trend we feel guilty buying into. The 
          | Open Closet is here to help you deal with it. Trends are fun, but 
          | not all of them are worthy of a purchase. We still believe fashion 
          | is the ultimate power tool; the source for self-expression, 
          | re-invention and discovery. Our mission is to provide a fashion
          | portal that provides an alternative and conscious way to enjoy fashion.
